    Context for use in testing to ensure that all warnings are raised.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import warnings
    >>> def foo():
    ...     warnings.warn(RuntimeWarning("bar"), stacklevel=2)

    We raise the warning once, while the warning filter is set to "once".
    Hereafter, the warning is invisible, even with custom filters:

    >>> with warnings.catch_warnings():
    ...     warnings.simplefilter('once')
    ...     foo()

    We can now run ``foo()`` without a warning being raised:

    >>> from numpy.testing import assert_warns
    >>> foo()

    To catch the warning, we call in the help of ``all_warnings``:

    >>> with all_warnings():
    ...     assert_warns(RuntimeWarning, foo)

    # and eradicate all those breadcrumbs that were left lying around.

    # We proceed by first searching all parent calling frames and explicitly

    Parameters
    ----------
    matching : list of strings or compiled regexes
        Regexes for the desired warning to catch

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> image = np.random.randint(0, 2**16, size=(100, 100), dtype=np.uint16)
    >>> # rank filters are slow when bit-depth exceeds 10 bits

    Notes
    -----
    Uses `all_warnings` to ensure all warnings are raised.
    Upon exiting, it checks the recorded warnings for the desired matching
    pattern(s).
    Raises a ValueError if any match was not found or an unexpected
    warning was raised.
    Allows for three types of behaviors: `and`, `or`, and `optional` matches.
    This is done to accommodate different build environments or loop conditions
    that may produce different warnings.  The behaviors can be combined.
    If you pass multiple patterns, you get an orderless `and`, where all of the
    warnings must be raised.
    If you use the `|` operator in a pattern, you can catch one of several
    warnings.
    Finally, you can use `|\A\Z` in a pattern to signify it as optional.
